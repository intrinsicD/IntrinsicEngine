# Runtime

`src/runtime` is the composition root for the engine. It owns
subsystem instantiation order, frame-phase orchestration, and deterministic
startup/shutdown.

## Public module surface

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Extrinsic.Runtime.Engine` | Composition root, frame loop, subsystem wiring, app-facing reference engine config helper |
| `Extrinsic.Runtime.FrameLoop` | Testable platform/render/maintenance/shutdown phase contracts |
| `Extrinsic.Runtime.ProceduralGeometry` | Procedural-geometry descriptor surface (`ProceduralGeometryKey`, key hash, `ProceduralGeometryCache` value type with `EnsureResident` / `Release` / `Find`). Reuses the `ProceduralGeometryKind` enum and POD `ProceduralGeometryParams` defined in `Extrinsic.ECS.Component.ProceduralGeometryRef`. `EnsureResident(key, uploadDesc, uploadFn)` either invokes the injected upload functor exactly once on a new key or hits an existing entry and increments a `std::uint32_t` refcount; `Release(key)` decrements. N entities sharing `(Kind, Hash(Params))` share one `GpuGeometryHandle`. No live ECS, no graphics imports beyond the existing `Extrinsic.Graphics.GpuWorld` value-type edge. Extraction-tick wiring and deferred-retire policy are GRAPHICS-030-Impl-B and GRAPHICS-030-Impl-C respectively. |
| `Extrinsic.Runtime.ProceduralGeometryPacker` | Per-kind packer `Pack(kind, params, scratch) -> std::optional<GeometryUploadDesc>` consuming a runtime-owned `ProceduralGeometryPackBuffer` reused across ticks. Triangle is the only in-scope packer for Impl-A; the vertex layout is `{pos.xyz, uv}` (20 bytes/vertex) matching `Test.MinimalTriangleAcceptance`. Cube / Quad / Sphere / LineStrip extend the enum + packer table without cache or extraction lifecycle changes. |
| `Extrinsic.Runtime.ReferenceScene` | Opt-in runtime-owned reference scene seam (GRAPHICS-029A/B). Exports `IReferenceSceneProvider`, `ReferenceSceneRegistry`, `ReferenceSceneEntity`/`ReferenceScenePopulation`, `TriangleProvider`, `MakeDefaultReferenceSceneRegistry()`, `RegisterDefaultReferenceProvidersIfAbsent()`, and `BuildReferenceCameraViewInput()`. `Engine::Initialize()` invokes `RegisterDefaultReferenceProvidersIfAbsent` so any unregistered selector receives its production default (currently `TriangleProvider` for `Triangle`), then resolves `EngineConfig::ReferenceScene::Selector` against `Engine::GetReferenceSceneRegistry()` exactly once after scene-registry construction and before `IApplication::OnInitialize`. The returned `ReferenceScenePopulation` is stored so `Engine::Shutdown()` routes teardown through the same provider before the scene registry is destroyed; the optional `CameraViewInput` seed is captured on `m_ReferenceCamera` for camera substitution. `m_ReferenceSceneInstalled` guards against double-install via `std::terminate`, and `ReferenceSceneRegistry::Resolve()` itself terminates on unregistered selectors (GRAPHICS-029 Decision 7 applied to both register and resolve). `TriangleProvider::Populate` calls `ECS::Scene::CreateDefault(scene, "ReferenceTriangle")`, attaches `Graphics::Components::RenderSurface{Domain = Vertex}` and `ECS::Components::ProceduralGeometryRef{Kind = Triangle}`, and returns a CameraViewInput seed (position (0,0,3), forward (0,0,-1), up (0,1,0), near 0.1, far 100). |
| `Extrinsic.Runtime.RenderExtraction` | Runtime-owned ECS-to-graphics extraction cache and snapshot handoff |
| `Extrinsic.Runtime.StreamingExecutor` | Persistent background streaming task execution |

`Extrinsic.Runtime.Engine` exports `CreateReferenceEngineConfig()` so reference
applications can request the standard runtime configuration without importing
lower-layer `core` config modules directly. Applications may pass the returned
config to `Engine`; runtime remains responsible for interpreting subsystem
configuration and composition. `CreateReferenceEngineConfig()` flips
`EngineConfig::ReferenceScene::Enabled = true` and
`Selector = ReferenceSceneSelector::Triangle`; the default-constructed
`EngineConfig{}` keeps `Enabled = false` so existing CPU/null tests do not
regress.

## Engine initialisation ordering

`Engine::Initialize()` runs the following ordered steps once per engine
lifetime (re-`Initialize` after `Shutdown` repeats the same order against
freshly-constructed subsystems):

1. `Core::Tasks::Scheduler::Initialize` — CPU fiber scheduler must be live
   before any task-graph or streaming dispatch runs.
2. Platform window, RHI device, renderer construction + `Initialize`.
3. CPU `FrameGraph` and streaming `TaskGraph` + `StreamingExecutor`.
4. `Assets::AssetService`.
5. `Graphics::GpuAssetCache` construction with the renderer's
   `BufferManager`, `TextureManager`, `SamplerManager`, and the device's
   `TransferQueue`. Immediately after construction the runtime calls
   `GpuAssetCache::InitializeFallbackTexture(...)` with the runtime-baked
   4×4 magenta-and-black `RGBA8_UNORM` checkerboard bytes and a
   nearest/clamp-to-edge sampler descriptor (RUNTIME-070). The call is
   gated on `m_Device->IsOperational()`; on the Null backend (or any
   non-operational device) the bootstrap is skipped and
   `GpuAssetCacheDiagnostics::FallbackTextureReady` stays `false`, leaving
   material code on its factor-only shading branch as documented in
   `src/graphics/assets/README.md`. A non-`Ok` result from
   `InitializeFallbackTexture` is logged as a single `Core::Log::Warn`
   breadcrumb and otherwise treated as a graceful "fallback unavailable"
   transition. The `AssetEventBus` listener is registered after the
   bootstrap attempt so a failed bootstrap does not block event
   subscription.
6. ECS `Scene::Registry` and the opt-in reference-scene bootstrap
   (GRAPHICS-029A/B).
7. `IApplication::OnInitialize`.

## Canonical frame loop phases (`Engine::RunFrame`)

1. Platform events / resize handling.
2. Fixed-step simulation.
3. Variable tick.
4. Render input snapshot.
5. Renderer begin frame.
6. Runtime render extraction: ECS queries, runtime sidecars, dirty-domain interpretation, deletion cleanup, and `IRenderer::SubmitRuntimeSnapshots()` handoff.
7. Renderer render-world extraction.
8. Render prepare.
9. Render execute.
10. End frame + present.
11. Maintenance: transfer retirement, streaming drain/apply/pump, asset service tick.
12. Frame clock finalize.

`Engine::RunFrame()` consumes `Extrinsic.Core.FrameClock` for wall-clock frame
delta sampling and post-sleep resampling; runtime owns the phase orchestration,
not the reusable clock value type.

## Streaming integration

`Extrinsic.Runtime.StreamingExecutor` is the primary persistent async streaming
execution path. `Engine` still carries a temporary compatibility bridge for
legacy `GetStreamingGraph()` producers while migration is in progress.

Shutdown order requirement:

1. `StreamingExecutor::ShutdownAndDrain()`
2. task scheduler teardown

## Dependency direction

`Runtime` depends on `Core`, `Assets`, `ECS`, `Platform`, and `Graphics`.
It orchestrates but does not own GPU barrier/resource policy or render-pass
branching logic.

`Extrinsic.Runtime.RenderExtraction` is the only promoted runtime owner for live
ECS render queries. It stores entity-to-graphics sidecars outside canonical ECS
components, allocates/frees `GpuWorld` instance handles through the renderer,
builds transform/light/visualization/gizmo snapshot records, and submits those
records to graphics through `IRenderer::SubmitRuntimeSnapshots()`. It also owns
the `GRAPHICS-023C` asset-generation observation bridge: when a renderable has
`AssetInstance::Source`, extraction can compare the normalized `Assets::AssetId`
with a supplied `Graphics::GpuAssetCache` view and `GpuSceneSlot` metadata to
report pending/up-to-date/rebind-required states without performing the later
GPU geometry or material rebind.

`RenderExtractionCache` also owns the procedural-source residency bridge
(GRAPHICS-030B). When a renderable candidate carries
`ECS::Components::ProceduralGeometryRef`, `ExtractAndSubmit()` derives the
`ProceduralGeometryKey` from `(Kind, Hash(Params))`, drives
`ProceduralGeometryCache::EnsureResident(key, desc, upload)` against the
runtime-owned `ProceduralGeometryPackBuffer` scratch and `GpuWorld::UploadGeometry`,
and on success calls `GpuWorld::SetInstanceGeometry(instance, geometry)`,
records the resolved key in the sidecar, and applies the procedural-source
sentinel rule by calling `GpuSceneSlot::ClearSourceAsset()` (per GRAPHICS-030
Decision 5). The packer is only invoked on a cache miss; cache hits do
refcount-only work. If a renderable also carries a non-default
`AssetInstance::Source`, the procedural path is skipped for that entity and
`ProceduralAndAssetSourceConflict` is incremented while the existing asset
observation continues. Retired or shutdown sidecars call
`ProceduralGeometryCache::Release(key)`; deferred-free retire ordering against
`GpuWorld::FreeGeometry` is reserved for `GRAPHICS-030C`. The added counter
fields on `RuntimeRenderExtractionStats` are
`ProceduralRenderablesEnumerated`, `ProceduralGeometryUploads`,
`ProceduralGeometryReuseHits`, `ProceduralGeometryFailedPack`,
`ProceduralGeometryMissingPacker`, `ProceduralGeometryInvalidParams`,
`ProceduralAndAssetSourceConflict`, and `ProceduralAndRenderableSourceConflict`
(reserved for future asset-backed renderable conflict detection in
GRAPHICS-034). `FindRenderableSidecarForTest(stableId)` and
`GetProceduralGeometryCacheForTest()` are read-only test seams used by the
`contract;runtime` procedural-geometry tests.

Runtime owns camera motion, input-to-pick-request translation, gizmo hit testing,
and transform application. Graphics receives only immutable `CameraViewInput`,
`PickPixelRequest`, and transform-gizmo render packets during extraction.

## Reference camera substitution (transitional)

When `EngineConfig::ReferenceScene::Enabled = true` and the resolved provider
returns a `CameraViewInput` seed, `Engine::RunFrame()` substitutes
`RenderFrameInput::Camera` with `BuildReferenceCameraViewInput(seed, viewport)`
before the renderer extraction phase. The helper finalises `View` via
`glm::lookAt(seed.Position, seed.Position + seed.Forward, seed.Up)` and
`Projection` via `glm::perspective(45° fovY, viewport.Width/viewport.Height,
seed.NearPlane, seed.FarPlane)`, then flips `Projection[1][1]` for Vulkan
clip-space Y inversion (matching the legacy `Graphics::CameraComponent`
update at `src/legacy/Graphics/Graphics.Camera.cpp:34-39`). Without the flip
the promoted Vulkan/reference-scene path would render the seeded triangle
vertically inverted and any screen-space derivations from the resulting
`CameraViewSnapshot` would use the wrong Y convention. The result still
passes the GRAPHICS-002 sanitiser used by `Graphics::BuildCameraViewSnapshot`
because the determinant check uses `std::abs`.

This direct substitution is intentionally a bridge. `RUNTIME-081`
(`Extrinsic.Runtime.CameraControllers`) and the broader `RUNTIME-002` umbrella
will consume the `CameraViewInput` seed as the active controller's *initial
state* and replace the direct read of `m_ReferenceCamera` with
`controller->Update(input, dt)` / `controller->GetView(viewport)`. The
`Engine::RunFrame()` substitution call site carries a `// TODO(RUNTIME-081)`
comment marking the mechanical retirement anchor.
