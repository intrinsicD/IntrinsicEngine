# Graphics/Backends/Vulkan

Promoted Vulkan 1.3 `IDevice` backend surface. Exports
`Extrinsic.Backends.Vulkan` with the `CreateVulkanDevice()` factory. The current
promoted lifecycle symbols are concrete and fail closed: until swapchain/device
bring-up is completed, `Initialize()` leaves the device non-operational and
`BeginFrame()` returns `false` instead of fabricating a frame. Full execution
requires a surface-capable physical device with `VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore`,
`VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing` (PARTIALLY_BOUND + UPDATE_AFTER_BIND), and dynamic
rendering (`VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering` / Vulkan 1.3 core).

## Frame lifecycle status

- `CreateVulkanDevice()` returns an `RHI::IDevice` instance without exposing
  concrete Vulkan types across renderer/RHI boundaries.
- The promoted device lifecycle methods (`Initialize`, `Shutdown`, `WaitIdle`,
  `BeginFrame`, `EndFrame`, `Present`, `Resize`, backbuffer extent/handle access,
  present-mode selection, and graphics-context lookup) are defined in
  `Backends.Vulkan.Device.cpp`.
- `Initialize()` currently reports that promoted swapchain/device bring-up is not
  complete and keeps `IsOperational() == false`; renderers must continue to gate
  GPU command recording on `IDevice::IsOperational()`.
- Runtime now has a backend-neutral operational-transition seam for future
  Vulkan bring-up: when a device moves from non-operational to operational,
  runtime waits idle and calls `IRenderer::RebuildOperationalResources()` to
  rebuild renderer-owned material, `GpuWorld`, culling, and depth-prepass state
  through RHI managers. Vulkan still remains non-operational in this directory;
  no swapchain, surface, or presentation path is enabled by that seam.
- Non-operational instances still return valid service references for
  `GetBindlessHeap()` and `GetTransferQueue()`. These fail-closed fallbacks do
  not allocate GPU slots or upload data; they return invalid indices/tokens and
  make maintenance calls no-ops so callers never dereference null backend state.
  Fallback bindless allocation attempts increment
  `GetFallbackBindlessAllocationAttemptCount()` and emit a logger breadcrumb for
  CPU-testable diagnostics.
- Buffer, texture, sampler, and pipeline `IDevice` overrides are symbol-complete
  in `Backends.Vulkan.Device.cpp`. They guard null/non-operational backend state.
  Texture creation now allocates VMA-backed `VkImage` objects and image views,
  and sampler creation creates real `VkSampler` objects once a future device
  bootstrap marks the backend operational; anisotropy remains disabled unless
  device feature negotiation records support. `WriteTexture()` now has a guarded
  synchronous staging-buffer upload path with mip/layer bounds checks, exact
  byte-size validation, sampled-usage validation, explicit depth-stencil upload
  rejection, and transfer-to-shader-read layout transitions that update tracked
  layout only after one-shot submission succeeds. Pipeline creation still returns
  invalid handles until shader/pipeline construction is wired.
- `Shutdown()` waits idle, flushes deferred deletes, and drains any still-live
  buffer, texture, sampler, and pipeline pool entries so partial bring-up slices
  do not leak backend resources when callers omit explicit per-resource destroys.
- Completing real Vulkan execution remains in `GRAPHICS-018`: create instance,
  surface, logical device, swapchain images, per-frame command buffers/sync,
  concrete resource creation/upload, pipeline creation, and presentation
  diagnostics before enabling opt-in `gpu;vulkan` smoke tests. The completed
  renderer reset seam removes one prior blocker, but Vulkan may not report
  operational until fallback bindless/transfer behavior and real backend
  resources are reconciled behind the same RHI interfaces.
- Renderer/RHI behavior that is not Vulkan-specific is documented canonically in
  [`docs/architecture/graphics.md`](../../../docs/architecture/graphics.md).

## Partition design

Internal Vulkan types are declared in focused non-re-exported module partitions.
Implementation `.cpp` files import the partition that owns the declarations they
define or consume. For example:

```cpp
module;
#include "Vulkan.hpp"   // provides VkDevice, VmaAllocator, etc.
module Extrinsic.Backends.Vulkan;
import :Transfer;       // gets StagingBelt/VulkanTransferQueue declarations
```

The umbrella `Backends.Vulkan.cppm` does **not** `export import` any internal
partition, so external consumers of `Extrinsic.Backends.Vulkan` see only
`CreateVulkanDevice()` plus fail-closed fallback diagnostics — concrete Vulkan
types remain hidden.

## Diagnostics

Vulkan backend implementation files use `Core::Log::*` for warnings/errors and
must not write directly to `stderr`. This keeps fail-closed backend diagnostics
visible through the same logging surface as renderer/RHI contract checks. The
`VK_CHECK_*` macros in `Vulkan.hpp` route through `ReportVkCheckFailure()` in
`Backends.Vulkan.DiagnosticsLogging.cpp` so the header remains module-import-free
while still using the project logger.
