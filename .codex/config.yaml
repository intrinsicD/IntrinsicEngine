  # Guidelines for the agent (It adheres to these strictly in 5.1)
  style_guide: |
    - Use C++20 Modules (.cppm) for interfaces.
    - Use LinearArena for per-frame allocations.
    - NO exceptions (-fno-exceptions).
    - Use std::expected for error handling.
    - Prefer Data-Oriented Design (SoA) over OOP.
