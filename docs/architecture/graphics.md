# Graphics Architecture

Graphics is organized into explicit sublayers:

- `graphics/rhi`: low-level rendering hardware abstraction.
- `graphics/vulkan`: Vulkan backend implementation.
- `graphics/framegraph`: transient render dependency graph and scheduling.
- `graphics/renderer`: high-level render orchestration using snapshots/views.

## Rules

- Graphics consumes immutable/snapshot data from higher-level systems.
- Graphics must not depend on live ECS ownership structures.
- Graphics-owned GPU handles, slots, leases, and backend resource IDs must not be stored in canonical `src/ecs` components.
- Runtime owns ECS-to-graphics extraction and any sidecar/cache mappings from ECS entities, asset IDs, or geometry source handles to graphics GPU handles.
- Runtime extraction is implemented by `Extrinsic.Runtime.RenderExtraction`, which queries live ECS, maintains entity-to-graphics sidecars outside canonical ECS components, and submits `RuntimeRenderSnapshotBatch` records through `IRenderer::SubmitRuntimeSnapshots()`.
- Backend code depends on RHI + allowed platform abstractions only.

## GPU scene ownership

- Runtime composes the CPU render scene from ECS, assets, geometry, transforms, materials, lights, selection, camera, and debug inputs.
- Graphics receives immutable `RenderWorld` / `RenderFrameInput` snapshots plus runtime-submitted transform/light/visualization record batches and uploads them into graphics-owned GPU scene buffers.
- `RenderWorld` currently exposes renderer-owned spans of `RenderableSnapshot`
  and `LightSnapshot` values, defaulted optional packets for picking,
  selection, shadows, debug primitives, postprocess/readback, and invalid-record
  diagnostics. Runtime-submitted batches are copied by the renderer before
  these spans are exposed, so no live ECS storage is retained by graphics.
- The promoted GPU-driven path should use a canonical instance-slot space shared by renderable records, transform records, bounds/culling records, material references, picking IDs, and draw buckets.
- `GpuWorld` owns retained managed vertex/index buffer ranges for uploaded geometry.
  Managed-buffer compaction is explicit and opt-in: callers first request a
  `PlanManagedBufferCompaction()` result, then may pass that exact generation-
  checked plan to `ApplyManagedBufferCompaction()`. The relocation table reports
  old/new geometry byte offsets and shader-visible vertex/index units so runtime
  sidecars can refresh extracted caches without graphics importing runtime or
  live ECS ownership. Compaction is skipped when disabled or below threshold and
  is blocked by default while deferred frees are still pending for frames in
  flight.
- Heavy CPU scene data lives in the owning subsystem or runtime extraction pools; canonical ECS components keep source data/IDs, not graphics backend resources.

## Pipeline and shader registry contract

- `Extrinsic.RHI.PipelineRegistry` is the promoted CPU-testable cache layer for
  deterministic shader/pipeline identities. It builds `PipelineKey` values from
  shader paths, shader generations, and the RHI `PipelineDesc` render state;
  matching keys return the same graphics-owned pipeline handle without requiring
  Vulkan shader compilation in the default CPU gate.
- Shader reload is represented as explicit invalidation by shader path. The
  registry drops affected cached leases and reports reload invalidation counts;
  callers request a new key with an updated shader generation to recreate the
  pipeline through `RHI::PipelineManager`.
- Missing shader IDs, key/descriptor mismatches, and backend pipeline creation
  failures are deterministic diagnostics. Backend-specific shader compilation
  remains behind RHI/backend integration and stays opt-in for GPU/Vulkan tests.
