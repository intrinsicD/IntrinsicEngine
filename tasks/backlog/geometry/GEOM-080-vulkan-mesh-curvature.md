# GEOM-080 — Vulkan mesh curvature and principal directions

## Goal

Implement Vulkan mean/Gaussian curvature and edge-dihedral tensor evaluation against the existing CPU curvature reference.

## Current state and scope

The current curvature fields and principal-direction calculations are CPU one-ring operations; no corresponding Vulkan method kernel was found.

Operator requested this candidate on 2026-09-17 after a source inspection.
This records authorized backlog planning outside the standing Framework24
selection preference; it is not a claim of GPU speedup or automatic adoption.
Use the existing CPU algorithm as the oracle, review its original formulation
and relevant later work, and complete the reference/tests/benchmark/optimized-CPU
evaluation sequence before a selectable GPU implementation. Keep algorithms,
precision requirements and default backend choices unchanged unless a separate
reviewed decision explicitly adopts a change.

Existing owners and evidence:

- [`src/geometry/Geometry.HalfedgeMesh.Curvature.cpp`](../../../src/geometry/Geometry.HalfedgeMesh.Curvature.cpp)
- [`src/runtime/Editor/Operations/Runtime.MeshFieldOperations.Curvature.cpp`](../../../src/runtime/Editor/Operations/Runtime.MeshFieldOperations.Curvature.cpp)

## Engine integration

| Field | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| Least-structured input | Canonical mesh positions plus the face/edge/vertex adjacency required by each curvature operator. |
| Compatible entity sources | Mesh sources meeting the existing curvature topology and finite-input requirements. |
| RuntimeModule | Runtime.MeshFieldOperations curvature family; keep GPU recording private and geometry APIs RHI-free. |
| Config/agent | This task owns backend selection through the existing family preview/validate/apply path; add only genuinely missing typed authoring/config and UI surfaces, with file/agent/UI parity. |
| UI | Same validated operation/readiness and requested/actual/fallback diagnostics; internal-only kernels use the named consumer tasks above. |
| Publication | Existing named per-vertex scalar and float-vector fields, with diagnostics and history unchanged. |
| End-to-end tests | This task owns CPU-oracle comparison, actual GPU readback, every supported input family, failed/stale/cancelled work and applicable config/UI/history coverage. |

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Preserve signed orientation, boundary handling, mixed areas and the dimensionless triangle-quality rejection threshold.
- [ ] Compare scalar fields and eigenspaces on planes, spheres, cylinders, folds, deleted slots and near-degenerate faces; do not require unique directions at repeated eigenvalues.
- [ ] Keep adjacency/geometry resident across compatible evaluations; compare complete cold and warm publication costs.
- [ ] Freeze parity tolerances, precision/device capabilities and representative
      fixtures before GPU tuning; do not weaken reference failure semantics.
- [ ] Reuse RHI, `ComputeParallelPrimitives`, framed JobService GPU work and
      `Graphics.GpuTransfer` where their contracts fit. Geometry/physics stay
      RHI-free; no parallel service/queue/registry, device-wide waits or borrowed
      ECS references survive asynchronous work.
- [ ] Prove requested/actual/fallback reporting and source revalidation through
      the declared control/publication path. Preserve canonical typed property
      eligibility, unrelated fields and topology; count changes are explicit.
- [ ] Register focused CPU cases and `GEOM080Vulkan` GPU cases (labels `gpu;vulkan`)
      and prove actual compute results against the independent CPU oracle.
      A fallback, skipped test or seeded reference-shaped GPU buffer is not proof.
- [ ] Reuse/extend manifest-backed benchmark harnesses with stable IDs and v2
      results under `build/ci-vulkan/benchmark-ctest/GEOM-080`. Measure cold/warm
      end-to-end time, transfers, compute, readback and memory against the current
      CPU/hybrid baseline. Benchmark fixtures run under the same `GEOM080Vulkan` selector.
- [ ] Update affected method manifests/backend documentation, canonical
      architecture notes and module inventory when interfaces change. Bind any
      capability/parity/performance conclusion to ARA evidence; no present
      performance claim follows from filing this task.

## Completion boundary

Target is actual Vulkan execution of the named stages with CPU-reference parity and complete declared integration. Any retained CPU stage must be named in results; shader presence or a GPU query alone does not close the task.

## Verification

Register the named suites and benchmark output as part of implementation.
For assessment-only rejection, run the CPU/candidate evidence actually needed
and record the negative gate; never fabricate successful production GPU evidence.
Required sanitizer/merge gates remain additional to this focused checklist.
