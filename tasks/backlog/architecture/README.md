# Architecture Backlog

Architecture and layering decisions, ADR-shaped tasks, and architecture
governance work. The authoritative engine contract is
[`/AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md); this directory tracks proposed or pending
decisions that may extend or refine that contract.

See [`tasks/backlog/README.md`](../README.md) for the cross-domain convergence
map.

## Tasks

- [ARCH-005 — Resolve graphics/RHI platform layering violations](../../active/ARCH-005-resolve-graphics-platform-layering-violations.md)
  (active): removes the current strict-layering failures where promoted
  graphics/RHI targets import or link `platform` for window/surface inputs.
- [RORG-031A — Architecture foundation backlog seed](RORG-031A-architecture-foundation.md):
  tracks architecture-doc normalization, layering-checker, docs-sync-checker,
  and module-inventory governance work.
- [RORG-036 — Layer ownership audit for misplaced concepts](RORG-036-layer-ownership-audit.md):
  inventories promoted modules whose value types, pure data contracts, or
  dependency-free APIs appear to live in higher layers than their true owner and
  creates one scoped follow-up task per accepted move/split.
- [DOCS-001 — Reduce `docs/architecture/graphics.md` to contract + status](../../done/DOCS-001-reduce-graphics-architecture-prose.md)
  (done 2026-05-17): shrank the 793-line `graphics.md` to 118 lines by
  extracting 15 embedded decision records into ADRs `0004..0018` and adding a
  Pointers section. Slice 1 (classification), slice 2 (15 per-ADR commits
  ADR-0004 through ADR-0018), slice 3 (no-op; the only migration-inventory
  row cross-linked to the existing parity matrix via ADR-0006), and slice 4
  (final tightening + Pointers) all landed.
- [ARCH-004 — Pin first legacy-deletion target and sequencing](../../done/ARCH-004-legacy-retirement-first-deletion-target.md)
  (done 2026-05-17): pinned `src/legacy/Interface/` as the first deletion
  target, recorded `src/legacy/Asset/` and `src/legacy/EditorUI/` as the
  second and third, and added the Sequencing table to
  [`docs/migration/legacy-retirement.md`](../../../docs/migration/legacy-retirement.md)
  so retirement is a tracked program rather than an indefinite "blocked"
  row. The executing task is `LEGACY-001` below.
- [LEGACY-001 — Delete `src/legacy/Interface/`](LEGACY-001-delete-src-legacy-interface.md):
  first concrete deletion under `ARCH-004`. Backlog until the consumer-grep
  prerequisite passes; promotion to `tasks/active/` is gated by `ARCH-004`.
- [REVIEW-001 — Establish weekly human-led review of agent-authored slices](../../done/REVIEW-001-human-led-agent-week-review-cadence.md)
  (done 2026-05-17): landed `docs/agent/agent-output-review-checklist.md` with
  the nine-row failure-mode checklist, added the cadence pointer to
  `docs/agent/contract.md` and the reviewer rotation note to
  `docs/agent/roles.md`, and ran the first calibration audit on the
  GRAPHICS-033E/F + HARDEN-066 + RUNTIME-091 window
  (`docs/reports/2026-05-17-agent-output-audit.md`, ≈ 15 minutes, eight rows
  pass, one self-corrected historical finding, no new follow-up filed).

## Convergence

These tasks contribute to **Theme F — Architecture/runtime/UI foundation
seeds** in the convergence map. Layering invariants remain owned by
`AGENTS.md`; any change here that introduces a new dependency edge or source
root must update the relevant `docs/architecture/*` doc set in the same PR per
[`docs/agent/docs-sync-policy.md`](../../../docs/agent/docs-sync-policy.md).
