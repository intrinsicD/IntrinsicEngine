# Architecture Backlog

Architecture and layering decisions, ADR-shaped tasks, and architecture
governance work. The authoritative engine contract is
[`/AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md); this directory tracks proposed or pending
decisions that may extend or refine that contract.

See [`tasks/backlog/README.md`](../README.md) for the cross-domain convergence
map.

## Tasks

- [RORG-031A — Architecture foundation backlog seed](RORG-031A-architecture-foundation.md):
  tracks architecture-doc normalization, layering-checker, docs-sync-checker,
  and module-inventory governance work.

## Convergence

These tasks contribute to **Theme F — Architecture/runtime/UI foundation
seeds** in the convergence map. Layering invariants remain owned by
`AGENTS.md`; any change here that introduces a new dependency edge or source
root must update the relevant `docs/architecture/*` doc set in the same PR per
[`docs/agent/docs-sync-policy.md`](../../../docs/agent/docs-sync-policy.md).
