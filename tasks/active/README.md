# Active Tasks

Place only currently in-progress or blocked tasks in this directory.

Each active task should include:

- Current status (`in-progress` or `blocked`).
- Owner/agent (if known).
- Branch and PR reference (if known).
- Explicit next verification step.

## Currently active

- [`ARCH-014`](ARCH-014-kernel-convergence-tracking.md) — kernel convergence
  umbrella; owner: Codex; coordination branch:
  `codex/arch-014-kernel-convergence-program`; blocked on final leaf
  `RUNTIME-187`. Next gate: execute the unblocked ADR-0027 behavior-owner
  leaves and update the convergence scorecard after each retirement.
- [`RUNTIME-129`](RUNTIME-129-schedule-gpu-normal-bake-after-import.md) —
  production object-space normal-bake orchestration; owner: Codex team;
  branch: `codex/runtime-129-operational-bake`; in progress. Next gate: close
  full-identity, collision-safe generated-asset, and exact cache-generation
  CPU contracts before the private Vulkan provider.
