# Active Tasks

Place only currently in-progress or blocked tasks in this directory.

Each active task should include:

- Current status (`in-progress` or `blocked`).
- Owner/agent (if known).
- Branch and PR reference (if known).
- Explicit next verification step.

## Currently active

- [`CI-005`](CI-005-real-touched-scope-pr-fast-gate.md) — route structural-only
  changes before C++ setup and use a registry-validated unsanitized `ci-fast`
  lane for focused or bounded broad feedback.

## History

Retirement narratives live in the append-only
[`tasks/done/RETIREMENT-LOG.md`](../done/RETIREMENT-LOG.md); this file
describes current state only. The retirement procedure is documented in
[`docs/agent/task-format.md`](../../docs/agent/task-format.md).
