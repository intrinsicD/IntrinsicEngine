# GEOM-015 — GJK termination diagnostics and scale-aware tolerance policy

## Goal
- Replace `Geometry::GJK::Config::GJK_EPSILON = 1e-6f` (and the scattered
  `1e-6f` magnitude guards in `Geometry.Support`) with a scale-aware,
  diagnostics-bearing tolerance policy that integrates with the
  `Geometry.RobustPredicates` foundation laid by GEOM-007.

## Non-goals
- Not a rewrite of the GJK algorithm itself; the existing iteration,
  simplex evolution, and direction-update structure stay as-is.
- No EPA / contact-manifold generation changes; this task only touches
  termination/degeneracy tolerances.
- No public API expansion of `Geometry.GJK` beyond what is required to
  surface termination diagnostics (early-out reason, iteration count).
- No new RobustPredicates surface beyond a single `ApproxZeroSq` /
  `ApproxZeroLen` helper unless a second callsite genuinely needs it.
- No paper-method-workflow work — Shewchuk-style adaptive predicates
  remain on the GEOM-007 Slice 4 / its own successor task.

## Context
- Status: in-progress (Slice 4 next; Slices 1–3 landed).
- Owner/agent: copilot.
- Branch: claude/active-geom-task-jaLRp (Slices 1–2 landed on
  claude/nice-knuth-QStLa, merged via PR #915 on 2026-05-22).
- Owning subsystem/layer: `geometry` (`geometry -> core`; consumes
  `Geometry.RobustPredicates`).
- Promoted from `tasks/backlog/geometry/` on 2026-05-22.
- Deferred from [`tasks/done/GEOM-007-robust-predicates-intersection-classification.md`](../done/GEOM-007-robust-predicates-intersection-classification.md)
  Slice 3.3.d, where the Slice 3.3 plan explicitly documented this as a
  successor-task candidate rather than a callsite-adoption sub-slice.

### Slice plan

- **Slice 1 (landed):** Add `RobustPredicates::ApproxZeroSq` /
  `ApproxZeroLen` helpers with `SignedResult`-shaped diagnostics and
  unit tests. No callsite migration; `Geometry.GJK` and `Geometry.Support`
  unchanged.
- **Slice 2 (landed):** Audit the GJK and Support 1e-6f callsites;
  classify and add inline comments. Migrate the original-space magnitude
  guards in `Geometry.Support.cppm` (Capsule direction, Cylinder
  axis-degeneracy + perpendicular projection, Ellipsoid radii) and the
  one in `Geometry.SDFContact.cppm` (separation-axis zero guard) to
  `RobustPredicates::ApproxZeroSq`, deriving `scale` from the primitive's
  characteristic length or from the unit-direction contract (relative =
  `1.0e-3` preserves the prior 1e-6 threshold at unit scale). Adds
  regression tests for the previously-flipped sub-millimeter Ellipsoid
  and short-axis Cylinder cases.
- **Slice 3 (landed):** Decided the GJK normalized-workspace policy:
  keep `GJK_EPSILON` as a dimensionless normalized-space constant
  (option (i) in "Required changes"); do not thread a per-call scale
  into the driver because the driver already factors the scale out via
  `invScale` and threading would double-normalize. Strengthened the
  in-source contract block above `Config::GJK_EPSILON` in
  `Geometry.GJK.cppm` and pinned the band with a `static_assert`
  requiring `GJK_EPSILON ∈ (0, 1)`. Added a new "GJK tolerance contract"
  subsection to `docs/architecture/geometry.md` describing the
  normalized-workspace contract, the rationale for not threading a
  per-call scale, where scale-aware tolerances live (Slice 2 migration
  in `Geometry.Support` / `Geometry.SDFContact`), and the static-pin.
  No callsite or runtime-behaviour change; existing GJK / Support /
  ContactManifold / Overlap / RobustPredicates tests continue to pass
  unchanged. Slice 4 (termination-reason diagnostics) is the remaining
  open slice.
- **Slice 4 (next):** Surface GJK termination diagnostics (`iterations`,
  `terminationReason`) via an overload or out-param. Keep the boolean
  entry point as a thin wrapper. Add convergence and parity regression
  tests.

### Slice 2 audit notes

GJK_EPSILON callsites in `Geometry.GJK.cppm` (all in normalized workspace;
inline comments record the classification):
- `Detail::NearlyZero` (line ~67): (a) normalized convergence — early-out /
  zero-direction guard, `|v|² ≤ EPS²`.
- `case 2` segment-degeneracy: (a) normalized convergence, `abLenSq ≤ EPS`
  (intentionally compared to EPS, not EPS², documented inline).
- `case 2` segment parameter clamp: (c) barycentric clamp on `t ∈ [0, 1]`,
  dimensionless; not a magnitude.
- `case 3` in-plane projection guard: (a) normalized convergence,
  `|abc · ao| ≤ EPS`.
- `GJK_Boolean` support-progress: (a) normalized convergence.
- `GJK_Boolean` simplex-membership duplicate test: (a) normalized
  convergence, `|p − support|² ≤ EPS²`.
- `GJK_Intersection` support-progress / membership: (a) — mirrors
  `GJK_Boolean`.

`Geometry.Support.cppm` 1e-6f callsites migrated to
`RobustPredicates::ApproxZeroSq`. Scale choices are deliberately
*axis-local* rather than `length(Radii)` / `shape.Radius` because those
larger scales spuriously trip the zero-band for anisotropic
primitives (e.g. an Ellipsoid with Radii = (1000, 1000, 1e-3) along its
thin axis, or a fat-disk Cylinder with R = 1000 and axisLen = 1):
- Capsule direction-magnitude guard: scale = 1.0 (unit-direction
  contract), relative = 1e-3.
- Cylinder axis-degeneracy: scale = 1.0 (numerical zero-vector floor on
  `axis`, not a shape-ratio test), relative = 1e-3.
- Cylinder perpendicular-projection guard: scale = 1.0 (perpLen ≤ |unit
  dir|), relative = 1e-3.
- Ellipsoid radii-scaled direction guard: scale = `min(|Radii_k|)`
  (worst-case smallest semi-axis ⇒ degenerate only when the smallest
  semi-axis is at machine zero), relative = 1e-3.

The `Internal::Normalize` `1e-12f` fallback in `Geometry.Support.cppm` is
out of scope for this slice — it is a true machine-zero guard rather than
a numerical-stability threshold and applies to bare direction vectors
shared across all primitives.

`Geometry.SDFContact.cppm` separation-axis guard migrated with scale =
1.0 (gradients are unit-normalized in `CalculateGradient`).

### Next verification step

After Slice 3 lands, the next slice (4) surfaces GJK termination
diagnostics (`iterations`, `terminationReason`) via an overload or
out-param plus a parity / convergence regression battery. Rerun on
slice landing:
`cmake --build --preset ci --target IntrinsicGeometryTests`
`ctest --test-dir build/ci --output-on-failure -R 'GJK|Support|ContactManifold|Overlap|RobustPredicates' --timeout 60`
plus `python3 tools/repo/check_layering.py --root src --strict`,
`python3 tools/docs/check_doc_links.py --root .`, and
`python3 tools/agents/check_task_policy.py --root . --strict`.
- Current state (as of GEOM-007 Slice 3.3.c landing):
  - `src/geometry/Geometry.GJK.cppm` defines `Config::GJK_EPSILON = 1e-6f`
    and uses it at 7 sites covering early-out direction, support-progress
    test, simplex-membership duplicate test, segment-degeneracy guard,
    barycentric clamp tolerance, and the in-plane projection guard.
  - `src/geometry/Geometry.Support.cppm` has three local `1e-6f` magnitude
    guards (`lenSq < 1e-6f`, `axisLen2 > 1e-6f`, `perpLen2 > 1e-6f`,
    `len2 < 1e-6f`) acting as zero-vector guards in support primitives.
  - `src/geometry/Geometry.SDFContact.cppm` has a `1e-6f` separation-axis
    guard at line ~66.
- Important design subtlety: `GJK_Boolean` and `GJK_Intersection`
  already normalize their workspace by `1.0 / shapeScale` (see comments
  at `Geometry.GJK.cppm:252–261`). The `1e-6f` tolerance is therefore
  *intentionally in normalized space* and is not the same kind of bug
  the GEOM-007 frustum migration fixed. Scale-aware policy in GJK proper
  may amount to documenting the normalized-space contract more clearly
  rather than introducing per-call scale arguments. The
  `Geometry.Support` and `Geometry.SDFContact` guards work in original
  shape space and *do* benefit from `RobustPredicates::ScaledEpsilon`
  derived from the local primitive's characteristic length.
- Downstream consumers that must continue to pass:
  - `tests/unit/geometry/Test_GJK.cpp`,
  - `tests/unit/geometry/Test_Support.cpp`,
  - `tests/unit/geometry/Test_ContactManifold.cpp`,
  - any contact / collision integration tests under `tests/integration/`
    that exercise overlapping shapes via the GJK fallback path in
    `Geometry.Overlap` (e.g. unhandled `Overlap_Analytic` pairs that
    fall through to `GJK_Boolean`).

## Required changes
- [x] Audit the GJK and Support epsilon callsites and classify each as
      (a) normalized-space convergence tolerance, (b) original-space
      magnitude/zero guard, or (c) barycentric clamp. Record the
      classification inline as a code comment and in the task notes.
      *(Slice 2: classifications added inline in `Geometry.GJK.cppm` and
      `Geometry.Support.cppm`; summary recorded above.)*
- [x] Add `RobustPredicates::ApproxZeroSq(double valueSq, double scale,
      double relative = 1.0e-9)` (and/or `ApproxZeroLen` for length-form
      callers) that returns a `Sign` / `Certainty` diagnostic compatible
      with the existing `SignedResult` shape. Add unit tests covering
      ordinary, near-zero, exactly-zero, and large/small scale cases.
      *(Slice 1, c93ae0b.)*
- [x] Migrate the original-space magnitude guards in
      `Geometry.Support.cppm` (and the one in `Geometry.SDFContact.cppm`)
      to the new helper, deriving `scale` from the primitive's
      characteristic length (sphere radius, capsule length, OBB extent
      diagonal, etc.). *(Slice 2.)*
- [x] In `Geometry.GJK.cppm`, either:
      (i) keep `GJK_EPSILON` as a normalized-space constant but document
          the contract explicitly and add a static assertion / runtime
          diagnostic when the normalized-workspace assumption is
          violated, OR
      (ii) thread a per-call scale into the GJK driver so the same
          predicate helper can be used. Pick exactly one based on the
          Slice 3 plan's "callsite adoption" intent and the audit
          results; document the decision in the architecture doc.
      *(Slice 3: option (i). The driver normalizes by `1/shapeScale`
      before any tolerance check (see `Geometry.GJK.cppm:281–294`) and
      every `GJK_EPSILON` callsite operates on that normalized
      workspace, so threading a per-call scale would double-normalize.
      Strengthened the in-source contract block and pinned the band
      with `static_assert(GJK_EPSILON > 0 && GJK_EPSILON < 1)`.)*
- [ ] Surface GJK termination diagnostics in the public result
      (`GJK_Boolean` already returns `bool`; consider an overload or
      out-param reporting `iterations`, `terminationReason` ∈
      { Converged, EarlyOutNegativeSupport, NoSimplexProgress,
      MaxIterationsHit }). Keep the existing boolean entry point as a
      thin wrapper.
- [ ] Update `src/geometry/CMakeLists.txt` and the generated module
      inventory only if a new module surface is exposed.

## Tests
- [ ] Add a parity test battery against the legacy `1e-6f` constant for
      GJK across small (object scale ~1e-3) and large (~1e3) shape
      sizes; non-degenerate cases must continue to report the same
      overlap boolean.
- [ ] Add a focused regression at the previously-problematic scales
      (e.g. two unit spheres separated by `2.0 + 1e-7` at scale `1e-3`
      vs scale `1e3`) where the old constant policy was known to flip;
      assert the new policy decides consistently with the geometric
      truth.
- [ ] If termination diagnostics are surfaced, add tests asserting that
      MaxIterationsHit is rare on the standard test corpus (i.e. the
      tolerance choice does not regress convergence).
- [ ] Confirm `Test_GJK.cpp`, `Test_Support.cpp`,
      `Test_ContactManifold.cpp`, and any GJK-fallback-driven
      integration tests in `Geometry.Overlap` still pass without
      modification.

## Docs
- [x] Update `docs/architecture/geometry.md` (Robust predicates section)
      with a paragraph describing the GJK tolerance contract:
      normalized-workspace constant vs scale-aware, and the rationale
      for the chosen path.
      *(Slice 3: added a new "GJK tolerance contract" subsection
      between "Robust predicates" and "Intersection classification
      records" that records the normalized-workspace decision, the
      reason for not threading a per-call scale, where scale-aware
      tolerances live (`Geometry.Support` / `Geometry.SDFContact` via
      GEOM-015 Slice 2), the `static_assert` pin, and the deferral of
      termination-diagnostics surface to Slice 4.)*
- [ ] If a new `ApproxZeroSq` / termination diagnostic surface is
      added, update `docs/api/generated/module_inventory.md` via
      `python3 tools/repo/generate_module_inventory.py --root src --out docs/api/generated/module_inventory.md`.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] All seven `GJK_EPSILON` callsites and the four `Geometry.Support`
      `1e-6f` guards are either migrated to the new helper or have an
      inline comment explaining why the legacy constant is retained.
- [ ] GJK's tolerance policy is documented in the architecture doc and
      no longer requires reading the implementation to understand the
      contract.
- [ ] Parity test battery shows no regression on the legacy corpus and
      records at least one previously-flipped scale where the new
      policy is now stable.
- [ ] `geometry -> core` (plus the existing GLM dependency) layering is
      preserved; no new graphics / runtime / ECS dependencies.

cmake --build --preset ci --target IntrinsicGeometryTests
